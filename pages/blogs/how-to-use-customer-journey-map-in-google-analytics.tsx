                                    Turns out, every analytics tool in the market excels in its own way. Take Google Analytics,
                                     Mixpanel, and Heap Analytics – they've got their strengths. But here's the kicker: 
                                     what we really wanted was a tool that's straightforward, adaptable, and, most importantly,
                                      a mix of web analytics, behavioral analytics, event analytics, and product analytics.
