                            A while back, we were hunting for a tool to amp up our SaaS game. We needed
                            the lowdown on our website's conversion rate, how folks were cruising through
                            our site, and what they thought about the latest features in our SaaS gig.

                        <h2 className="my-2 mt-8 font-bold text-2xl">Our Motivation</h2>
                        <p className="mt-3">

                            – they've got their strengths. But here's the kicker: what we wanted was a tool that's straightforward,
                            adaptable, and, most importantly, a mix of web analytics, behavioral analytics, event analytics,
                            and product analytics.
